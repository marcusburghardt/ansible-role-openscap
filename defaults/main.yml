# Role defaults

# Some tasks need admin permissions. This will be done with "become" parameter of Ansible.
# The default method is "sudo". So, ensure your username has sudo permissions to install
# packages and change system files, such as repository files.

# When working with many branches it is useful to see the current branch in the PS1
# environment variable. If the below variable is enabled, the PS1 will get a nice and
# simple update which can help the navigation between branches.
ps1_update: False

# These repositories are usually what your need to work in the project.
# For this environment, the role is using two "types" of repositories:
# - fork: Repositories with this "type" are cloned into the "Forks" folder.
#         If you want to contribute with the project, it is recommended that you fork
#         the desired repository and send PR from the fork to upstream. I also recommend
#         to make your changes on new branches instead of working the master branch of
#         your fork. This will make the PR creation easier.
# - lab:  Repositories with this "type" are cloned to the "Labs" folder. Usually you
#         don't need these labs, but they are good if you like hands-on approach.
#         Instructions regarding the labs are provided in INSTRUCTIONS_LABS.md file.
